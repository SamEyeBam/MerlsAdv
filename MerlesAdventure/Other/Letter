Dear Merle

This is my gift to you, full of some adventures and some (horrible) jokes.
This letter is actually something called an "easter egg" so i'm unsure if you're ever going to find it.

With that said i think you're amazing and even though i wont know you forever, i hope you never forget that one time that weird guy who always forgets something made you a game.

From the one and only...

		Sam..
